		<h2>Steps:</h2>
		<p>1. Hit ctrl + shift + p <i>(for windows, command + shift + p for apple)</i> to bring up the Command Pallate.</p>

		<p>2. Start typing <i>Install</i> and you should see a pop up that says <i>Package Control: install package</i>. Install it.</p>

		<p>3. You should see something called <i>Browser Packages</i> tab on top of sublime 3. if not, you have to go to the website linked bellow and follow those instructions to download it.</p>

		<p>4. Once you have downloaded <i>Broswer Sync</i> and see the tab on top of sublime, click it, then click launch. If you use chrome, you are good to go and it works! Otherwise, follow these last set of steps.</p>
		<br>

		<h2>Steps if you don't use chrome:</h2>

		<p>1. Navigate to the <i>Preferences</i> tab, located next to the <i>Help</i> Tab.</p>
		<p>2. Click Browse Package.s</p>

		<p>3. It will open up a folder with 2 folders inside, one should say <i>user</i> and one should say <i>BrowserSync.</i>. Click on <i>Browser Sync</i>.</p>

		<p>4. Look for the application called <i>browser_sync_launch</i>. You will <b>DRAG AND DROP INTO SUBLIME TEXT, DON'T DOUBLE CLICK IT</b>. It should open a new file in sublime text.</p>

		<p>5. Lastly, go to where it says <i>browser:"chrome"</i> and change chrome to whatever browser you will be using for HTML,CSS,and Javascript coding!!</p>

		<p>6. To launch, do the same thing as Step 4 in the last part. Have fun coding!!</p>
